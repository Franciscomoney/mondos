# UI Fixes Applied

## 1. Hydration Error - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Date formatting was different between server and client
```
- Before: new Date(doc.created_at).toLocaleString()
- After: new Date(doc.created_at).toISOString().replace('T', ' ').slice(0, -5)
```
This ensures consistent date format between server and client rendering.

## 2. Missing Action Buttons - FIXED ✅
**Changes made**:
- Improved button layout with flexbox
- Added visual separators between links
- Fixed URL paths for HTML/MD downloads
- Added "No output available" message for failed documents
- Delete button now always visible (as it should be)

## 3. Current Document Status
- **Document 5** (administracion senor otalora.pdf): 
  - Status: Completed ✅
  - Has HTML and MD files
  - Should show: View HTML | Download MD | Delete
  
- **Document 14** (cartapresidente.pdf):
  - Status: Failed ❌
  - No output files
  - Should show: "No output available" | Delete

## To Process the Failed Document

1. **First, change the OCR model**:
   - Go to: http://155.138.165.47:10001/settings
   - Change OCR Model to: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
   - Save settings

2. **Then try processing again**:
   - Click "Process 1 Document" button
   - The PDF should process successfully

## Why the OCR Failed
- Claude Haiku has limited PDF support
- Gemini models don't support PDFs at all
- OpenAI GPT-4 models have the best PDF support

The UI should now properly show all buttons and avoid hydration errors!
